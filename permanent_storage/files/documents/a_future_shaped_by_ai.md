## A New Vision for Computing

In an age where the average person checks their smartphone 96 times a day, can you imagine your devices understanding and responding to your needs using natural language? Welcome to the future shaped by AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). This is a world where devices, not limited by specific controllers, interact with us using the most intuitive communication form we know: our language.

Since the invention of the first digital computer, humanity has been on a relentless quest for innovation, transforming our lives in ways we couldn't have anticipated. Computers were the first wave of this digital revolution, making tasks simpler and enhancing productivity. The internet ushered in the second wave, creating a global network of interconnected devices. Now, we stand on the brink of the third wave, where our daily devices evolve beyond their current capabilities, powered by the intelligence of AI and LLMs.

## Reinventing Computers: The Role of AI and LLMs

Modern devices - laptops, phones, cars - are embedded with computing capabilities. Their value lies in their ability to automate tasks and process information dynamically. Traditionally, each device required its own software controller to operate, a system that is both isolated and difficult to scale. But what if we could reimagine this system?

Enter the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of developing separate software controllers for every device, we could use our everyday language as a programming medium. Here's how it works:

Devices gather information through sensors. Think of these as the device's ears and eyes, collecting data from the environment. This information is then acted upon by components called actuators, which are like the device's hands and feet. They carry out actions, such as making a sound or printing a document. This whole process, which was once controlled by individual software, would now be managed by the LLM.

The main job of an LLM is to understand natural language and make intelligent decisions. So, if your phone's sensor 'hears' you say, 'Play my favorite song,' the LLM processes this instruction and directs the actuator (in this case, your phone's speaker) to play the music. It's like having a personal assistant in every device, using your language to understand and respond to your needs.

## AI-Powered Agents

This groundbreaking approach gives birth to a new entity in our quest to reinvent computing - the AI-powered agent.

An agent, as we define here, is an entity with memory and the ability to perform actions. It interacts with an LLM, retrieving its memories, sending a prompt based on a specific goal, and interpreting the response to update its memories or perform an action. These agents can exist virtually anywhere, running on any electronic device.

We can segregate an agent into four primary components:

- **Memory**: Can be stored locally or on a cloud server. To amplify the agent's potential, we propose using cloud-based memory.
- **Agent flow**: This is a prompt library that processes memories and events, formulates prompts, and interprets responses. It's a lightweight wrapper capable of running on any device.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Serving as the brain of the agent, the LLM receives and processes the prompts generated by the agent flow. Its outputs are designed in a format that is interpretable by the agent, enabling subsequent actions.
- **Capabilities**: These are the tools or functions the agent can use to impact the real world. The abilities are device-dependent and rely on the available software. For instance, a smart speaker's capabilities could include playing music or setting alarms, while a smart refrigerator might be able to monitor and reorder groceries.

## Harnessing the Power of Multi-agent Systems

Imagine the possibilities of numerous agents coordinating to achieve complex tasks. These agents, not restricted to a specific device, can communicate using natural language. When multiple agents across various devices collaborate, they form a network of distributed intelligence, capable of orchestrating complex behaviors based on shared knowledge.

Picture this: you're away from home, chatting about a movie with friends. You note the movie's name on your phone. Your phone agent reads the note, communicates with your computer agent, who saves the info and checks where the movie is streaming. When you get home, your agent reminds you of the film. All you have to do is relax on the sofa, and your smart TV starts the movie. Afterward, you can discuss the movie with your agent, whose memory will shape future movie recommendations.

More complex scenarios are within reach. Suppose you're assigned group homework. Communicate the task to your computer agents, and they'll start the research. By the time you get home, your work is ready for review. If your friends also have agents, they can collaborate, each contributing to the shared work. The possibilities are endless.

## Conclusion

The future we're envisioning is one shaped by AI and orchestrated by intelligent agents. These agents, powered by LLMs, break down device boundaries, streamline tasks, and create an interconnected intelligence network. They're set to revolutionize our day-to-day life, offering unlimited potential and unprecedented convenience.

In this world, our devices won't be mere tools; they'll be companions, learning from us, adapting to us, and continually evolving to meet our needs. They will bring a new level of simplicity and intuitiveness to our interactions with technology, making our lives easier and more connected. So, as we stand on the brink of this exciting new era, one thing is clear: the future is here, and it's powered by AI.

Now, let's engage in a thought experiment. How would your daily life change if your devices could understand and respond to your commands using natural language? How much simpler could tasks become? How much time and energy could you save?
